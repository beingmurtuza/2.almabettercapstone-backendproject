**Short summary of the Back-end Capstone Project :**

Created an application using MongoDB , NodeJS and expressjs to get the array of subscribers from the data present in MongoDB.

=> Initially, all the dependencies and node modules are installed using the “npm install” command. 

=> Then, run the “node src/createDatabase.js” to store the dummy data from data.js file to your local MongoDB server in your computer. 

=> At last, run “node src/index.js” or “npm start” to start the backend server.

We’ve used 3 different main http requests for Searching the data in the database.

1. GET http://localhost:3000/ => Which is used to Display the written message on the homepage to the client.

2. GET http://localhost:3000/subscribers => Request is used to get an array of all subscribers from the database.

3. GET http://localhost:3000/subscribers/names => Request is used to get an array of all subscribers with only name and subscribedChannel fields from the database.

4. GET http://localhost:3000/subscribers/:id => Request is used to get a particular user from the database,client need to replace the  :id is replaced by the user’s id in the url to get particular data from the databases.
